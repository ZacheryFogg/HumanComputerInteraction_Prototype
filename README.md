# HumanComputerInteraction_Prototype

Instructions for using UI: 

Although the audio output will instruct you on this upon UI startup: 

To gesture with the touchscreen (mouse input) click and hold for approximately 1 second (the word "vibrate" will appear in the console 
to demonstrate the intent to give haptic touch) and swipe in a direction: up, down, left, right. Sometimes a gesture will produce no actions 
in a context. 

To dictate a voice command, double tap anywhere, voice a command, wait 2 seconds, the UI will automatically parse and perform an action if 
your command matches any of the primitive commands. The possible commands for a context can be heard by dictating 'help' or by looking at the
list of valid commands (this written list is just there for demonstration purposes - the information will be given in audio output format)
